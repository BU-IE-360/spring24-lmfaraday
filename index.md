## Project
This project focuses on predicting future solar energy production values for Edikli GES, leveraging advanced time series modeling techniques. ARIMA models and penalized regression methods were employed to achieve more accurate predictions. The project was a collaborative effort carried out by a team of two, using data provided by their professor.
